when you searched for a city the recent search dropdown will appear. It will show 4 recent searches, if you have searched only one city it will show only one city in the dropdown. 



About the project:- 

1. This code is responsive for three type of screens. 
    → dektop
    → iphone SE
    → ipad mini
2. The searched data will store in the local storage, it will help us to get the data even after closing or refreshing the tab. 
3. The input fields will validate to prevent errors like empty field and invalid city name. 
4. I have used openweathermap to get the weather data by creating an api id.
